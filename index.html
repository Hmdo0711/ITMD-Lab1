  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hello, my name is Hieu Do, first year Apllied Cybersecurity major. I was born in Vietnam and moved to Chicago 5 years ago. I like anime, light novels, online games, board games. For outdoor activity I like to hike, play tenis, ice skate, skiing, and bowling (although I suck at it). I don't have a pet but I do want some caique parrots because birbs are the best. </p>
